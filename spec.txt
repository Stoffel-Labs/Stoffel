I'll design a comprehensive CLI for Stoffel that takes inspiration from cargo and anchor while being tailored to the unique needs of privacy-preserving computation. Let me create an artifact with the complete CLI specification.I've designed a comprehensive CLI for Stoffel that draws inspiration from cargo and anchor while being tailored specifically for privacy-preserving computation. Here are the key highlights:

## Core Design Principles

**Modern & Extensible**: Like cargo, it uses TOML configuration files and supports workspaces for multiple programs. The plugin system allows for future extensibility.

**Developer Persona Aware**: Includes templates for different developer types:
- Web3: `--template web3-auction`, `--template web3-private-voting` 
- Web: `--template web-healthcare`, `--template web-fintech`
- Desktop: `--template desktop-secure-messaging`
- Hardware: Built-in TEE deployment support

**Flexible Project Structure**: Supports both standalone projects and integration into existing codebases with `stoffel init --lib --path ./privacy`.

## Key Features

**Smart Initialization**: 
- Interactive setup with `stoffel init --interactive`
- Template-based initialization for common use cases
- Both standalone and library integration modes

**Complete Development Workflow**:
- `stoffel dev` with hot reloading and multi-party simulation
- `stoffel test` with MPC-specific testing suites  
- `stoffel build` with optimization for different targets

**Production-Ready Deployment**:
- TEE deployment with attestation support
- Multi-environment configuration (local/staging/production)
- Integration with cloud providers and Kubernetes

**Future Package Manager**: Built-in support for `stoffel add` and `stoffel publish` commands, ready for the Stoffel package ecosystem.

The CLI structure anticipates the three-component Stoffel architecture (Lang, Compiler, VM) while providing clear separation between programs, integrations, and deployment configurations. This makes it easy for developers to understand and extend their privacy-preserving applications.
