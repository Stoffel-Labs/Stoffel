# Contributing to Stoffel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Stoffel! We welcome meaningful contributions that help advance secure multiparty computation technology.

## üö® Anti-Spam Policy

**We do not accept:**
- AI-generated pull requests without substantial human review and understanding
- Trivial typo fixes or minor formatting changes
- Mass automated contributions across repositories
- Pull requests that show no understanding of the codebase or MPC concepts

**All contributors must:**
- Demonstrate genuine understanding of the changes they propose
- Include detailed explanations of their reasoning and approach
- Show familiarity with MPC concepts and StoffelLang when relevant

## üìã Before You Contribute

### Read and Understand
1. **Read the README thoroughly** - Understand what Stoffel does and how it works
2. **Explore the codebase** - Familiarize yourself with the project structure
3. **Test the CLI** - Try the commands and understand the user experience
4. **Review existing issues** - Check if your contribution addresses known problems

### Technical Prerequisites
- Experience with Rust programming language
- Familiarity with CLI design principles and command-line tools
- Understanding of build systems and project scaffolding
- Basic knowledge of template systems and code generation

### Repository Scope
This CLI repository focuses specifically on:
- **Project scaffolding** - Templates and project initialization
- **Development tools** - Build, compile, and development commands
- **Developer experience** - Help systems, error messages, and workflow optimization
- **Integration** - Connecting with StoffelLang compiler and runtime components

**Out of scope for this repository:**
- MPC protocol implementations (separate repositories)
- StoffelLang compiler development (Stoffel-Lang repository)
- VM runtime and execution engine (StoffelVM repository)
- SDK implementations (language-specific SDK repositories)

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### High-Value Contributions
- **CLI performance optimizations** - Improvements to command execution speed, file processing, or build times
- **Developer experience enhancements** - Better error messages, improved help system, workflow optimizations
- **Template system improvements** - New language ecosystem templates, better project scaffolding
- **Documentation improvements** - Comprehensive CLI guides, tutorials, or API documentation
- **Test coverage expansion** - Integration tests for CLI commands, template generation tests, compilation tests
- **Build system improvements** - Cross-platform support, dependency management, packaging

### Medium-Value Contributions
- **New language templates** - Support for additional programming language ecosystems
- **CLI usability improvements** - Enhanced command interfaces, better flag documentation
- **Integration features** - Support for new deployment targets, IDE plugins, development environment integrations
- **Configuration management** - Improved project configuration, template customization

### Not Accepted
- Simple typo fixes or cosmetic changes
- Automated code style adjustments without functional improvements
- Adding comments without improving code clarity
- Renaming variables for aesthetic reasons
- Trivial refactoring without performance or maintainability benefits
- **Underlying MPC protocol implementations** - These belong in separate repositories, not the CLI
- **StoffelLang compiler changes** - Language development happens in the Stoffel-Lang repository

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Start with an Issue
**Required for all contributions:**
- Open an issue describing your proposed contribution
- Explain the problem you're solving and your proposed approach
- Wait for maintainer feedback before starting implementation
- Reference the issue number in your pull request

### 2. Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Stoffel

# Build dependencies
cargo build

# Build Stoffel-Lang compiler (required for testing)
cd ../Stoffel-Lang
cargo build
cd ../Stoffel

# Run tests
cargo test

# Test CLI functionality
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- init test-project
cargo run -- compile test-project/src/main.stfl
```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality Standards
- **Rust best practices** - Follow idiomatic Rust patterns and conventions
- **Error handling** - Use proper Result types and meaningful error messages
- **Documentation** - Include inline documentation for public APIs
- **Testing** - Add unit tests for new functionality
- **Security** - Consider security implications of all changes

#### Commit Guidelines
- **Meaningful messages** - Describe what and why, not just what changed
- **Atomic commits** - One logical change per commit
- **No merge commits** - Rebase feature branches before submitting
- **Sign commits** - Use `git commit -S` for verified commits (recommended)

#### CLI-Specific Considerations
- **Command correctness** - Ensure CLI commands work as documented and handle edge cases
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Verify commands work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Template generation** - Ensure generated projects compile and run successfully
- **Error handling** - Provide clear, actionable error messages for common failure cases
- **Integration testing** - Test CLI commands with real StoffelLang files and project structures
